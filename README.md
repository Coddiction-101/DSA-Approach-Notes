# DSA Approach Notes 📚

A structured, interview-focused collection of Data Structures and Algorithms notes, patterns, and problem-solving approaches.  
Designed to help you **think in patterns**, not just memorize code.

---

## 📚 Structure

This repo is organized by **topic** and **pattern**, so you can quickly revise the core idea before jumping into problems.

---

## 🎯 Why This Repo?

- **Pattern-first approach**: Each file teaches a **pattern** (e.g., Two Pointer, Sliding Window, Kadane) with minimal code and maximum intuition.  
- **Interview-ready**: Focuses on what’s actually asked in coding interviews (LC Easy/Medium).  
- **Quick revision**: Perfect for last-minute prep before mock interviews or real interviews.  
- **Language-agnostic**: Concepts are explained in plain English; code is in C++ but easy to adapt.

---

## 📌 How to Use

1. **Pick a topic** (e.g., `Array/`).  
2. **Read the pattern files** in order (e.g., `01_Basics.md` → `05_Two_Pointer.md`).  
3. **Solve problems** on LeetCode/Codeforces using that pattern.  
4. **Revise** by quickly skimming the `.md` files before interviews.
